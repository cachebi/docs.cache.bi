## Introduction

Cache.bi has been developed to assist end-users of POS systems review and analyse their sales 
and financial data (customer and inventory coming soon) in an easy to use and highly adaptable environment.

A choice of customisable Dashboards presents the desired data to the user without the need to be at the back of
office or trolling through emails of automated pdf reports. Designed to be accessible on any screen format, 
desktops, tablets and phones, no matter what you are using to access your portal, you can see live, historic 
analytical data.

No SQL knowledge or coding is required. All data filtering and selections are done through quick toggle switches 
or dropdown selection.

### Panel Types

* `Sales Panels` - Show data relating to sales of products.
* `Financial Panels` - Show data relating to financials.
