A choice of customisable Dashboards presents the desired data to the user without the need to be at the back of
office or trolling through emails of automated pdf reports. Designed to be accessible on any screen format, 
desktops, tablets and phones, no matter what you are using to access your portal, you can see live, historic 
analytical data.

No SQL knowledge or coding is required. All data filtering and selections are done through quick toggle switches 
or dropdown selection.
