# Groups

## Creating your first Group

Groups are sections of a Dashboard that then contain Panels of data visualisations. Groups make viewing your data simple and most of all, easy to use on mobile devices.
Whilst you are able to create as many Groups as you want on a single Dashboard, it is best to keep to 5 or less to ensure speedy loading of all data.

To create a Group, click on the GROUP button at the top right of the Dashboard. You will then be prompted to "Name" the Group. Choose a description that best suits the data that you intend to visualise in that Group.

If more Groups are available than your screen allows, you are able to navigate left and right along the Group list by using the buttons in the centre top of the Dashboard << < > >> which move "To First Group", "Left One Group", "Right One Group", "To Last Group".
